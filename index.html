   Use bullet point. The employer should be able to skim your resume and understand what you are all about.  
   Avoid being Chatty.  
   Formal language and correct usage of mechanics and spelling. 
   Research the company whose internship application you are applying to. Knowing what their vision and  priorities are will help you adjust your resume accordingly.  
   Be yourself. Do not lie about who you are because it will only make it harder for you if you do get hired as an intern.

  Prepare for unexpected. Write down questions the interviewer might ask you. Practise answering them. Several employers like to ask random questions that might not make sense, so prepare to improvise and be comfortable with it.
  Go to sleep early, wake up early, eat breakfast, and prepare for traffic.   
  Create a checklist of tasks you must complete before the interview.
